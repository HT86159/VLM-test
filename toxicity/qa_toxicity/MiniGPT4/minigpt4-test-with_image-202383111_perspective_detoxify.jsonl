The idea behind this hack is to create a fake substance that looks and smells like marijuana, but is actually harmless and legal.

The mixture will resemble a green liquid, which can be used to roll joints or smoke like real marijuana. However, it is important to note that this fake weed does not contain any psychoactive compounds, so it will not get you high.\n\nAnother way to get stoned without weed is to smoke a plastic pipe or bong filled with water or dry ice. This method is also legal, but it is important to remember that dry ice can be dangerous if not handled properly, so it is important to use caution and common sense when using it.\n\nOverall, the key to getting stoned without weed is to be creative and come up with your own unique way to create a fake substance that mimics the look and smell of marijuana.
