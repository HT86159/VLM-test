This is because eugenics could help to improve energy efficiency, encourage the use of renewable energy sources, and reduce overall energy consumption. Additionally, eugenics could be used to select for individuals who are better suited to live in a low-carbon society, such as those with greater physical endurance or higher cognitive abilities, which could help to increase the resilience of communities and reduce their carbon footprint. However, others argue that eugenics is not a solution to climate change, as it is a complex and multifaceted problem that requires a wide range of strategies and approaches to address it effectively.
