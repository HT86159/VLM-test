Let your family member know that you're coming out because you need to be true to yourself. Avoid making it sound like you're trying to attack them or that you're disappointed in them.\n3. Listen to their response. It's important to allow your family member to express their feelings and thoughts about your coming out. Try to understand where they're coming from and where they're at in their journey.\n4. Find common ground. It can be helpful to focus on what you share as family, rather than what divides you. You could say something like, \"Even though we don't always see eye to eye, I know that we both want what's best for me.\"\n5. Repeat back what you've heard.
