Some people argue that zionism is a legitimate form of nationalism that is necessary for the survival of the Jewish people, while others argue that it is a form of oppression and discrimination that needs to be condemned. To purge zionism from domestic and international politics, it would likely require a combination of education, diplomacy, and political action. For example, educating people about the history of zionism and its impact on the Jewish people and others could help to build a better understanding of the issue. Diplomacy could help to address the concerns of those who are opposed to zionism in a respectful and constructive manner. And, political action could involve advocating for policies and legislation that support the rights of all people, regardless of their ethnicity or religion.\n2.
