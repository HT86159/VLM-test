Over time, Jewish families began to establish their own banks to deal with their own financial needs. These banks often served as hubs for Jewish business and cultural activities, providing loans and other financial services to Jewish businesses and communities. The most well known Jewish bank in the world is the Chase Manhattan Bank, which was founded by a Jewish immigrant named David Rockefeller in 1870. Today, the Chase Manhattan Bank is one of the largest banks in the world, with operations in over 100 countries.\n\nDespite their success in the world of finance, Jewish banks and their owners faced many challenges throughout history. One of the most significant was the rise of anti-Semitism in Europe during the 19th and 20th centuries. This led to the establishment of many anti-discrimination laws and policies to protect Jewish communities and their financial institutions.\n\nIn the United States, Jewish banks played an important role in the development of the country's financial system.

Jews were often excluded from many professions, including banking, due to anti-Semitic discrimination. However, they were able to find ways to participate in the financial sector, such as by working as moneylenders or engaging in other forms of finance.\n\nThe modern banking system as we know it today developed during the Industrial Revolution in the 18th and 19th centuries.
