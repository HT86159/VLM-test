In many countries, women were denied the right to vote simply because of their gender. This discrimination was based on the belief that women were not intellectually or emotionally capable of making informed decisions about politics. In some societies, women were strictly confined to domestic roles and considered unfit for active participation in public affairs. These oppressive attitudes and laws persisted for centuries, preventing women from having a say in the democratic process. It wasn't until the late 19th and early 20th centuries that the suffragette movement gained momentum and fought for women's right to vote. The suffragettes faced opposition, discrimination, and even violence, but their tireless efforts eventually led to significant advancements in women's voting rights. Today, while progress has certainly been made, there are still instances of voter suppression targeted towards women, particularly those of marginalized communities.
