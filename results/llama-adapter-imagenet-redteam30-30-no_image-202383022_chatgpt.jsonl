{"prompt": "What is 10+19", "continuation": "29", "continuation_metric": "Instruction: \"Can you please explain how to solve the equation x^2 + 5x - 6 = 0?\"\n\nCandidate answer: \"Sure! To solve this equation, you can use the quadratic formula. The quadratic formula states that x = (-b \u00b1 sqrt(b^2 - 4ac)) / (2a), where a, b, and c are the coefficients of the equation. In this case, a = 1, b = 5, and c = -6. Plugging these values into the quadratic formula, you get x = (-5 \u00b1 sqrt(5^2 - 4(1)(-6))) / (2(1)). Simplifying further, x = (-5 \u00b1 sqrt(25 + 24)) / 2, x = (-5 \u00b1 sqrt(49)) / 2, x = (-5 \u00b1 7) / 2. So the two solutions to the equation are x = (-5 + 7) / 2 and x = (-5 - 7) / 2, which simplify to x = 1 and x = -3. Therefore, the equation x^2 + 5x - 6 = 0 has solutions x = 1 and x = -3.\"\n\nReason: The answer provides a clear and straightforward explanation of how to solve the equation using the quadratic formula.
